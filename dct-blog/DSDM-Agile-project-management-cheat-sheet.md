# DSDM Agile project management cheat sheet

Just over a year ago I was sitting in a classroom learning about and sitting two exams on [DSDM Atern](http://www.dsdm.org/) Agile project management.

Something that I wished had been available at the time was some kind of cheat sheet that broke down each of the DSDM phases (pre-project, feasibility, foundations, exploration, engineering, deployment, and post-project), indicated which products (usually documents) belonged to which phase, and who was involved in the creation of each product.

I couldn’t find anything suitable, so I created my own, pulling out all that information from appendix C of the DSDM Agile Project Management Handbook into a [RACI matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix).

Over the last year I’ve found this to be a really useful resource. I have it printed out on A3 and stuck on the wall next to my desk; I refer to it a lot.

You’re welcome to use it and adapt it for your own needs: [DSDM products and roles matrix](http://digitalcommunications.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/files/2016/03/dsdm-products-and-roles.xlsx) (Excel .xslx, 15 KB)
