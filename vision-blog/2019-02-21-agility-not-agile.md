# Be agile not Agile™

Thursday 21 February 2019

In 2014, Dave Thomas, one of the seventeen who met at Snowbird ski resort in Utah and came up with the Agile Manifesto, wrote a blog post with a wonderfully clickbait title: "Agile is dead (long live agility)".

In the article he laments that too many people focus on 'Agile' with a capital 'a' as though it was a brand: Agile™.

Agile isn't a noun (a naming word, my primary school teacher would drill into us), agile is an adjective (a describing word). Thomas urges us to think about agility not Agile.

"The word “agile” has been subverted to the point where it is effectively meaningless, and what passes for an agile community seems to be largely an arena for consultants and vendors to hawk services and products." — [Dave Thomas](https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html)


## Agile principles

I've been thinking a lot recently about agile principles. What are the fundamental truths that serve as the foundations of agile development—sorry, of development that shows agility?


### Agile manifesto

Of course we have the Agile manifesto:

"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

"That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."


### Scrum values and pillars

Scrum has five core values:

* Commitment
* Courage
* Focus
* Openness
* Respect

and three pillars

* Transparency
* Inspection
* Adaptation


### AgilePM (DSDM) principles

I'm fond, too, of the eight principles on which AgilePM (formerly DSDM Atern) is built:

1. Focus on business need
2. Deliver on time
3. Collaborate
4. Never compromise quality
5. Build incrementally from firm foundations
6. Develop iteratively
7. Communicate continuously and clearly
8. Demonstrate control


### Bertrand Meyer

Bertrand Meyer in _Agile!: The Good, the Hype and the Ugly_ (Springer, 2014) argues for the following principles that promote agility:

1. Put the customer at the centre
2. Let the team self-organise
3. Work at a sustainable pace
4. Develop miniminal software
   i.   Produce minimal functionality
   ii.  Produce only the code requested
   iii. Develop only code and tests
5. Accept change
6. Develop iteratively
   i.   Produce frequent working interactions
   ii.  Freeze requirements during iterations
7. Treat tests as a key resource
   i.   Do not start any new development until all tests are passed.
   ii.  Test first
8. Express requirements through scenarios


## Back to basics

Dave Thomas finishes his blog post by showing us how to do something in an agile fashion:

1. Find out where you are.
2. Take a small step towards your goal.
3. Adjust your understanding based on what you learned.
4. Repeat.

And "when faced with two or more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes future change easier."

That's it.

Orientate, plan, do, check, adjust, repeat.


## Where do we need to focus?

I've often found these lists of principles useful to focus the mind on what's important about working with agility.

Which principles stand out as those we need to focus on

* as a company?
* as a team?
* as an individual?

What is the next small step we need to take?
