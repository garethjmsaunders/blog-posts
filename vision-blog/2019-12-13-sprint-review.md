# What should happen during a sprint review?

Monday 16 December 2019

In Scrum, towards the end of each sprint, two important events are held that help teams to inspect how they are doing and make adjustments as required: the sprint review and the sprint retrospective. 

The events are usually held in that order: review then retrospective. One often feeds the other. The sprint review looks at the current state of the product being developed and how that affects the overall product backlog; the sprint retrospective then focuses on the processes created to most efficiently deliver the plan to build the next iteration.

For many, the sprint review has become synonymous with simply a demonstration of the progress made during the sprint, walking people through the new features and fixes that have been completed. While that is one part of a sprint review, as the book _Scrum Mastery_ by Geoff Watts says, the difference between a good Scrum team and a great Scrum team is that while the good team's sprint review looks back and reviews the product built during the last sprint, a great team's sprint review also looks forward to shape the product in future sprints.


## Sprint review agenda

So how might a team achieve this?

Combining some of the best ideas from various Scrum resources and offer the following as a simple agenda for a sprint review. There are four sections to the meeting:

1. Set the scene
2. Reflect on what went well and what didn't
3. Demonstrate stories that are done
4. Look to the future


### 1. Set the scene

Product Owner, development team

* What were the sprint goals?
* What will be demonstrated? (Explain what product backlog items have been done and therefore will be demonstrated.)
* Optional: What is the definition of done? This is what determines what will be demonstrated.
* Has the sprint goal been met?

BURNDOWN CHART?
STATS?


### 2. Reflect on what went well and what didn't

Product owner, development team, scrum master

* What went well in the sprint?
* What problems/impediments were uncovered?
    * Why did they happen?
    * What has been done/is being done to remove them?
* What process improvements have been put in place?


### 3. Demonstrate stories that are done

Development team

* Demonstrate each user story/feature that has reached the definition of done from the perspective of a user. Feedback and questions welcome from the rest of group. 
* Optional: Coming soon session on work-in-progress.


### 4. Look to the future

Product owner, development team, scrum master

The product owner discusses what the team will do next. The outcome of this meeting is an input into subsequent sprint planning meetings. In other words, how does what we learned today impact our future plans?

* New velocity
* New estimates/projected milestones
* New plan
* New design
* New process
* New priorities
* New release
* New requirements
