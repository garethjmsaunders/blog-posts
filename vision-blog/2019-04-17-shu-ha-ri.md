# Shu Ha Ri

Tuesday 16 April 2019

As Jeff Sutherland, the co-creator of Scrum, reminds us in his book _Scrum: the art of doing twice the work in half the time_ (Random House, 2014), "Scrum has its roots in Japanese thought and practice".

One of the ideas that Scrum has drawn on is the Japanese martial art concept of _shuhari_ (or _shu ha ri_) which describes three stages of learning towards mastery.

Over the last few years, I have found this a really useful model to bear in mind when working with teams as they embrace and grow towards agility.


## Shu

The first stage of mastering something is shu (守), which roughly translates into English as 'protect', 'obey', 'observe'.

In this state, the student learns the rules, forms and patterns of the discipline. The rules are followed and not deviated from. They are repeated and absorbed.

In the film, _The Karate Kid_ (1984), Mr Miyagi sets Daniel to do menial tasks like painting fences and waxing cars ("wax on, wax off") which frustrates Daniel as he feels that Miyagi is simply using him as a slave. But this is the _shu_ state: learning the basic patterns, feeling the rhythm, learning muscle memory.

For teams learning Scrum and agility this can be learning the rhythm of the events (sprints, daily scrum, refinement meetings, sprint review and retrospective), learning to use the backlog and write better user stories.


## Ha

The next state is _ha_ (破), which roughly translates as 'detatch', 'digress', 'broken'. Once you have mastered the forms, you can begin to break them and make innovations.

When I was learning Hebrew at university, I would first write the Hebrew characters exactly as I had been taught, almost printing them. In my second year, the characters were familiar. I could write them without thinking and having read more Hebrew and experienced more font faces, I began to adapt a few of the characters to make them mine.

For teams learning Scrum and agility this can be adapting the daily stand-up meeting to not slavishly follow the three question format (What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any impediments?), or XXXXXX.

EXAMPLE

--
ha () "detach", "digress"—breaking with tradition—detachment from the illusions of self

### Ri

The final state in the road to mastery is _ri_ (離), which roughly translates as 'leave', 'separate', 'depart'.

For teams learning Scrum and agility this can mean not estimating stories because they now instinctively create small stories that will be delivered to live within a day or two.


--
ri () "leave", "separate"—transcendence—there are no techniques or proverbs, all moves are natural, becoming one with spirit alone without clinging to forms; transcending the physical
