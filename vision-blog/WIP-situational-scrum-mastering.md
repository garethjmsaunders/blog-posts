A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a blog post about the Japanese concepts of _shu ha ri_ as a model for considering progress towards agile maturity.

> At the start you 'obey' (_shu_) your coach's instructions. Once you understand why you are doing it you begin to 'detatch' (_ha_) and adapt. And finally, after further practice you can 'leave' (_ri_) those early practices behind, fully make the discipline your own and coach others.

I concluded by asking: where is your team on this journey? Do you need to take more time to focus on the foundations, replay the patterns and rehearse the basics? Or is it time to innovate and push the boundaries of what you've learned to find more agile ways of working?
