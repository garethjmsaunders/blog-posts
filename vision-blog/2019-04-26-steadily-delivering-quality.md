# Steadily delivering quality

Friday 26 April 2019

This week it was revealed that car hire company [Hertz has sued Accenture for US$32 million](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/23/hertz_accenture_lawsuit/) for failing to deliver either a functional website or mobile app during a 16-month digital transformation project.

While there is a lot that could (and will) be said about this. It's quite remarkable that even now digital and software development projects are still being carried out using traditional 'waterfall' project management approaches with all the design and planning done up-front rather than using an agile, just-in-time approach.


## Fixed or variable?

In every project there are four key elements:

* Features (requirements)
* Time
* Resources (cost)
* Quality

Whether these elements are regarded as fixed or variable is what distinguishes one project management methodology from another.


## Traditional

In so-called 'traditional' or 'waterfall' projects features are fixed.

Requirements are gathered, plans are drawn up and the project does not finish until the last feature has been delivered.

If the project goes off-track, more money and resources are thrown at the project and the deadline slips further and further away.

As projects get later, often quality also suffers, as this cartoon demonstrates:

This is what happened to the Hertz/Accenture project. Started in August 2016, a new website and mobile app were meant to be launched in December 2017. The project was abandoned in May 2018. Nothing was usable; nothing was launched.


## Agile

In contrast, an agile approach to project management fixes time, resources (cost) and quality. It is the features that are variable.

A minimum viable product (MVP) will be delivered quickly, tested with real users and iterated on to bring more features to market incrementally.

Time is fixed using fixed-length sprints. Resources are fixed using established teams who stay together for months. Quality is fixed by establishing good testing disciplines, agreeing on common practices, and establishing a solid definition of done.

There is an old military adage that even the best plan goes awry after the first contact with the enemy. So it is with projects: there ought to be an expectation that features will evolve and change as you learn more about the product during development, user testing and once those new features have been delivered to end users.

As our own agile journey continues, we would benefit from bearing in mind the eight principles of the AgilePM framework:

1. Focus on business need
2. Deliver on time
3. Collaborate
4. Never compromise quality
5. Build incrementally from firm foundations
6. Develop iteratively
7. Communicate continuously and clearly
8. Demonstrate control


## What next?

The Vision Tasks team has recently delivered v1.4 to SIT and ELS. This is a major milestone for the project and a huge confidence boost for the team. (Well done, Tasks team!) This is a fabulous foundation on which to build, incrementally.

Over the next few months, I'd like to see one of the focuses for the team to be working towards being able to deliver releasable features at the end of each sprint (even if they don't immediately get put into production).

There is some work to be done first to get us to that point but that's the goal: steadily delivering quality.
