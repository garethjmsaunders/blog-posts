One of my favourite podcasts is _Eat Sleep Work Repeat_ hosted by [Bruce Daisley](https://twitter.com/brucedaisley), the European Vice-President for Twitter. I was delighted when I heard earlier this year that he was publishing a book, _The Joy of Work_ (2019).

The subtitle of this his first book promises a lot: "30 ways to fix your work culture and fall in love with your job again". The book is arranged into three sections which he claims together create happier work environments:

* Recharge—ways we can help recharge our own batteries.
* Sync—suggestions about how to encourage trust.
* Buzz—ideas, based on research, that can help teams reach a state of 'buzz'.

Each chapter relatively short, easy to read and is packed with great, up-to-date research and ends with a few practical ideas about how you could implement that idea.


## Recharge

The first section offers 12 performance-enhancing actions to make work less awful:

1. Have a monk-mode morning—silent and distraction free.
2. Go for a walking meeting—seemingly, it makes you more creative.
3. Celebrate headphones—they can really help you focus by shutting out the noise around you.
4. Eliminate hurry sickness—don't see gaps in your schedule as moments when you are not working, celebrate space—sometimes you have your best idea when you are doing 'nothing'.
5. Shorten your work week—stop celebrating overwork, go home on time, break your day into small chunks. Burnout and exhaustion are no good for your creativity.
6. Overthrow the evil mill owner who lives inside you—don't be a tyrant, don't jokingly say 'half day?' when someone comes in at 10:00. Don't give people a hard time about their hours especially when work has some flexibility.
7. Turn off your notifications.
8. Go to lunch—it's better for your mental health.
9. Define your norms
10. Have a digital sabbath—for example, don't email afterhours
11. Get a good night's sleep
12. Focus on one thing at a time
