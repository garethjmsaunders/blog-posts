# The importance of small user stories

I've been thinking a lot recently about the importance of small user stories


A few months ago, I invited the Tasks team into a meeting room for a game of 


Small stories keep work flowing
From queuing theory (Poppendieck and Poppendieck 2003; Reinertsen 1997), we learn the importance of focusing on _cycle time_, the amount of time something takes to go from the start of a process to the end of that process. On a software project, cycle time is the time from when the team begins work on a feature until that feature delivers value to users. The shorter the cycle time, the better.

A key influence on cycle time is the variability in the time it takes to develop a new feature. One of the best ways to reduce variability is to work with reasonably small and similar size units of work. The estimating and planning process outlined in this book supports this by advising that teams estimate their short-term work within approximately one order of magnitude. Larger user stories can exist further down a project's prioritized requirements list. However, as those features near the top of the list (when they will be scheduled into an iteration that is beginning), they are disaggregated into smaller pieces.
