# The importance of small user stories

Thursday 29 August 2019

I've been thinking a lot recently about the importance of small user stories in agile projects.

This blog post, [Story points revisited](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/019-01ff/story-points/Index.html), by agile manifesto signee Ron Jeffries has inspired me to explore this idea further.




—the importance of breaking down user stories into as small chunks as is practical.

Here is some of my thinking.

## Battleship

A few months ago, I invited the Tasks team into a meeting room for a game of Battleship, that strategy-type guessing game for two players played on a 10×10 grid. 

I wanted to demonstrate to the team why smaller user stories are better than larger. In the game, each player takes turns in guessing where their opponent's ships are located.

Player 1: E5
Player 2: Miss... H8
Player 1: Hit... B2
Player 2: Miss
etc.

I wanted the team to imagine that each guess was a user story. Except, I changed the rules for the second team.




Small user stories 

* more predictable
* less risk/uncertainty
* less complexity
* take less time






Small stories keep work flowing
From queuing theory (Poppendieck and Poppendieck 2003; Reinertsen 1997), we learn the importance of focusing on _cycle time_, the amount of time something takes to go from the start of a process to the end of that process. On a software project, cycle time is the time from when the team begins work on a feature until that feature delivers value to users. The shorter the cycle time, the better.

A key influence on cycle time is the variability in the time it takes to develop a new feature. One of the best ways to reduce variability is to work with reasonably small and similar size units of work. The estimating and planning process outlined in this book supports this by advising that teams estimate their short-term work within approximately one order of magnitude. Larger user stories can exist further down a project's prioritized requirements list. However, as those features near the top of the list (when they will be scheduled into an iteration that is beginning), they are disaggregated into smaller pieces.
