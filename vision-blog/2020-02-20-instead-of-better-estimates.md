I came across a [tweet from John Cutler](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1048820946650316800) a couple of weeks ago that has been challenging me. He wrote:

> Instead of focusing on making 'better' estimates, focus on:

> * working smaller
> * integrating frequently
> * exposing work to users/customers sooner
> * testing assumptions earlier
> * limiting dependencies
> * less fragile code
> * limiting handoffs
> 
> Your estimates will improve
