# Sprint planning in Scrum

Thursday 21 March 2019

At our last retrospective, the Vision Tasks team decided to restructure our sprint timetable. With our two-week sprints running from Monday to Friday, it felt a bit disjointed to hold the end of sprint review and retrospective on the Monday morning of the new sprint; sprint planning was then squeezed into a one-hour slot on Monday afternoon.

Under the new timetable, the sprint review and retrospective are now held on the afternoon of the last Friday of sprint. This should help us round off the sprint nicely without the hiatus of a weekend. But it also frees up the whole day, potentially, on the first Monday of sprint for planning.




## Time box

The Scrum Guide time-boxes sprint planning to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month sprint. Proportionally, this means planning should last no more than four hours for our two-week sprints.


### Two topics

During sprint planning the team is asked to answer two questions:

* What can be delivered during this sprint?
* How will this work be achieved?

These don't need to be separate meetings but the order of questions is important: _what_ then _how_.
