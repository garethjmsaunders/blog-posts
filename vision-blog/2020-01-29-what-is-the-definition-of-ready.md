# What is a Definition of Ready?

Wednesday 29 January 2020

While the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) encourages teams to create a Definition of Done, so that everyone understands what 'done' means, it says nothing about creating a Definition of Ready, so that everyone understands what pre-conditions must be met before a user story is allowed onto a sprint.

This is the closest the Scrum Guide gets:

> "Product Backlog items that can be 'Done' by the Development Team within one Sprint are deemed "Ready" for selection in a Sprint Planning. Product Backlog items usually acquire this degree of transparency through the above described refining activities." ([Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html))

[Mike Cohn](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-dangers-of-a-definition-of-ready) compares a Definition of Ready to a bouncer standing at the door of a sprint, determining who may and who may not be allowed to pass.

More than simply being able to be completed on a sprint, a Definition of Ready contains wider criteria that a user story must pass before it is regarded as sprint-ready. For example,

* The user story contains enough background information for the team to understand.
* The user story is estimated and under a certain size.
* UX is mocked up/fully designed.
* User story has no external dependencies.
* Acceptance criteria are agreed and documented.

From a risk management perspective, having a Definition of Ready can be a good thing. The team mitigates against potential incidents by ensuring that a certain level of detail is already present on the user story before development beings. Ensuring that a user story is small enough to be completed within a single sprint sounds like a sensible idea. As does outlining acceptance criteria that may be used to direct both development and testing.

The problems lie when the Definition of Ready is treated as a waterfall-stype stage gate that insists on the previous stage being completed to 100% before moving on to the next. Mike Cohn explores this idea in a blog post called [A Definition of Ready could be a dangerous step towards a stage-gate process](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-dangers-of-a-definition-of-ready).

I have always found a short, practical Definition of Ready to be a useful tool during backlog refinement meetings and sprint planning meetings. They can act as gentle guidelines to ensure that a developer or tester has the optimal amount of information required to begin working on that user story but which don't absolutely block user stories. The iterative nature of agile development means that teams will often uncover unexpected insights during coding that couldn't have been considered during refinement or planning.

A good approach to writing a Definition of Ready might be to always include guidelines rather than hard-and-fast rules.
