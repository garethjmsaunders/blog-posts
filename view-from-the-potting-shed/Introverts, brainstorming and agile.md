# Introverts, brainstorming and agile

## Introverts

I have long identified as an introvert, so it was with a certain delight and relief that I began reading _Quiet: the power of introverts in a world that can't stop talking_ by Susan Cain. The blurb on the back of the book says:

> For far too long, those who are naturally quiet, serious or sensitive have been overlooked. The loudest have taken over—even if they have nothing to say.

> It's time for everyone to listen. It's time to harness the power of introverts. It's time for _Quiet_.

> Quiet—Susan Cain

Shhh...!

Introversion is not, as one dictionary defines it, simply "a shy, reticent person" but is rather more complex than that. 

Introverts tend to need less external stimulation than extroverts—while in groups and at parties extroverts feel alive, these same events tend to drain introverts. 

Extroverts tend to enjoy working quickly on tasks, they are comfortable with taking risks and leaping from one task to the next; introverts on the other hand prefer to work more slowly and methodically, needing longer periods of quiet for concentration.

When I was at theological college we spent a few days one summer school looking at the Myers-Briggs type indicator (MBTI) which utilises the introvert and extrovert distinction. When the results came back we learned that about three-quarters of the cohort were introverts. 

We were handed a task (I can't remember what now) and told to break off into small groups and discuss the problem we'd been presented.

As you might expect, the single extrovert's group in the far corner were noisier than every other group combined—they laughed and shouted, guffawed and were having a whale of a time, while members of the other introvert groups looked around periodically with disapproving stares before turning back and whispering to their own group members or writing in their notebooks, quietly getting their thoughts out of their heads in the best way they knew.

After 15 minutes when we had to report back to the plenary, one introvert spokesman said, "And it was at this point that we broke off into groups of ones and twos".

Groups of one?! How much more introvert can you get than that!

When I moved to web development I found a similar split. It cames as no surprise to learn that the majority of people I worked with on software, web and digital projects also identified as introverts.

Introversion lends itself to this kind of work—spending long periods of time on one's own, thinking deeply and solving problems.

As I've been reading _Quiet_ (and I am currently only a third of my way in), I have been considering how these insights into quiet, introvert and often highly sensitive people has an impact on how to get the best out of Agile teams full of them.

## Brainstorming

One thing that has struck me so far is related to what the book says about brainstorming and the **influence** this has **on team size** and how we run certain Agile events such as **planning poker** and **retrospectives**.

Brainstorming, as we know it today, was the brain child of advertising executive Alex Osborn who (ironically) came up with the idea on his own. 

The story goes that he was frustrated that his employees were not creative enough and he believed that what was holding them back was fear of peer criticism. So he insisted they work together and gave them four rules to follow:

1. Don't judge or criticise any suggestion.
2. Be wild with your ideas—the wilder the idea the better.
3. Offer lots of ideas—the more the better.
4. Iterate on other people's ideas.

Osborn's belief was that freed from the fear of peer judgment groups would produce more and better quality ideas than individuals working on their own.

Except, it turns out he was wrong. There have been a number of psychological studies now that have proven that as group size increases the number and quality of ideas decreases.

> "Groups of nine generate fewer and poorer ideas compared [with] groups of six, which do worse than groups of four."

> _Ibid_, p.88
> 
The reason, psychologists tells us, is threefold. First, in a group some people tend to sit back and let others do all the work. Second, only one person can be active while the others sit and listen. And third, people hold back, they don't want to look stupid in front of their peers.

Unless they are working collaboratively online, it seems. Not only do distributed teams produce more and better ideas than both individuals and co-located small teams, their quality also improves as the distributed group increases.

These insights surely have an impact on how we run Agile teams.

## Team size

When I was going through my DSDM (Agile project management) qualification, one thing our tutor kept stressing was getting the size of the team right.

DSDM recommends a team size of between 5 and 9—they define it as seven plus or minus two (7±2). Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon defines the ideal team size as one that can be fed by no more than two pizzas. The textbook reason being that teams of this size benefit from minimum formality, management overhead and risk and are still small enough to take ownership of their processes.

Smaller teams benefit introverts—in smaller groups there is less stimulation so introverts don't feel so overwhelmed as quickly.

It seems clear then, from the evidence about brainstorming that if you need an Agile team to generate a lot of ideas quickly you have a few options to get the best out of them.

* **Smaller teams**—when brainstorming, break the teams down as small as possible, maybe teams of three, and give the group members permission to even break off into sub-groups of ones and twos if they need to.
* **Go online**—or how about creating an online space where the whole team (plus stakeholders) can brainstorm collaboratively. I've used [Trello](https://trello.com/) for this very effectively in the past when some team members have been remote and others local.

## Planner poker and retrospectives

There are a number of Agile events or rituals that often require some kind of brainstorming or group thinking activities. I'm thinking of **planning poker** and **retrospectives**.
